### Projects
During my 3 years of PhD training I have been working in projects related to improving the interpretability of machine learning algorithms, in particular, the treatment of categorical predictors in Generalized Linear Models. As a results of this work I have one publication in a top journal in Artificial Intellingence
* Carrizosa, E., Restrepo, M. G., & Morales, D. R. (2021). On clustering categories of categorical predictors in generalized linear models. Expert Systems with Applications, 115245.
* Carrizosa, E., Galvis Restrepo, M., and Romero Morales, D. (2020). A binarization approach to model interactions between categorical predictors in Generalized Linear Models. Working  Paper 

Currently, I am working on a project on fair machine learning, combining the methods designed in the previous research, to include fairness as an objective in the process of optimizing the algorithms.
