## Machine Learning Research Projects
Improving the interpretability of machine learning algorithms, in particular, the treatment of categorical predictors in Generalized Linear Models. 

### On clustering categories of categorical predictors in generalized linear models. 
In this project, a joint work with my PhD advisors, we develop a methodology to cluster the categories of categorical predictors. The aim was to have an alternative, more compact representaiton of the categorical features which reduces the number of coefficientes to estimate and interpret. I developed an R package that implements the methodology. The package is available in github https://github.com/mgr-eco/clustcat. The paper is published in a highly ranked Artificial Intelligence journal and available here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349179679_On_Clustering_Categories_of_Categorical_Predictors_in_Generalized_Linear_Models

### A binarization approach to model interactions between categorical predictors in Generalized Linear Models. 
In this project, we consider the possibility of having interactions between the categorical predictors, in that context, the complexity of the model is much higher and we propose a method to reduce that complexity by binarizing the categorical predictors which takes into account categorical predictors and their interactions. The working paper is available here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350755054_A_binarization_approach_to_model_interactions_between_categorical_predictors_in_Generalized_Linear_Models

### Fair treatment of categorical predictors 
Currently, I am working on a project on fair machine learning, combining the methods designed in the previous research, to include fairness as an objective in the process of optimizing the algorithms.
